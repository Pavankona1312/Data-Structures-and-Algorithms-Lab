Introduction
------------

In this lab, you will be exploring pattern searching within text
This lab is divided into three parts - the first involves implementing
the KMP algorithm, while the second is an implementation and simple application of tries.
The extra problem is plag-checker, which was part of the project last year.

Please find the problems in folder kmp, trie, and plag-checker.

Read

- kmp/README.md                   (practice)
- trie/README.md                  (practice)
- plag-checker/README.md          (bonus)

You must solve kmp and trie.
